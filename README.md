# brainfuc
BrainFuC - a Brainfuck interpreter in C.
This was mostly done as a challenge to see how fast I could do it. Maybe I'll make this in other languages.
If you're curious, this took about 20 minutes.

HOW TO USE THIS "tool":
1. Run 'make' in any command line
2. Run program with the following format: ./brainfuc [FILENAME]
